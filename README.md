<h1 align="center">MediStore App</h1>

## Project_description

The MediStore application will enable pharmacy administrators to efficiently manage their pharmaceutical inventory. Users, such as administrators and regents, will be able to register and log in to access the system's functionalities. Within the application, users will be able to create and update product records, specifying details such as presentation (tablets, capsules, syrups), date of entry and expiration date, with automatic validations to ensure data accuracy. In addition, they will be able to manage product batches, track product status (available, sold, damaged or expired) and track product details using barcodes. For a better user experience, the application includes a responsive interface, which would facilitate its use on mobile devices, allowing real-time inventory management from anywhere.
