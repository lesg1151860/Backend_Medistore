<h1 align="center">MediStore App</h1>

## Project_description

The MediStore application will enable pharmacy administrators to efficiently manage their pharmaceutical inventory. Users, such as administrators and regents, will be able to register and log in to access the system's functionalities. Within the application, users will be able to create and update product records, specifying details such as presentation (tablets, capsules, syrups), date of entry and expiration date, with automatic validations to ensure data accuracy. In addition, they will be able to manage product batches, track product status (available, sold, damaged or expired) and track product details using barcodes. For a better user experience, the application includes a responsive interface, which would facilitate its use on mobile devices, allowing real-time inventory management from anywhere.

After being located in our repository, we enter Python mode by typing the command "py" to verify that we have Python installed. Exit the Pyhton environment with the command "exit()". Create a new folder with the command "mkdir" and assign it a name, in our case it will be 'project'.

Enter the newly created folder with the command "cd" and create an environment with the following command "py -m venv venv".

We use the following command ".\venv\Scripts\activate.bat" to activate and enter the local Python environment. Once inside the local environment we use the following command "pip install django" to install Django in our local Phyton environment.
